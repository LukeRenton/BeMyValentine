# Be my valentine 
> This repo is heavily based and expanded on the project: https://github.com/saurabhnemade/will-you-be-my-valentine
> I have added a desktop application applicability to it (using `electron`) incase you don't want to use it as a website and would rather just package it as a desktop app.

Project for anyone to expand on (whichever cool features they can think of) to ask someone to be your valentine.
